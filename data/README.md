# SACAC EDA workshop - access to data
Repository to host the SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop files (25 March 2024)

GitHub is not an appropriate platform to host data. All the datasets used in this workshop can be accessed from the following [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1znDhqDdkzqc2MeZwCpWly3YvjMvUarei/view?usp=drive_link). 

Please download the ZIP-file, then load the data into your own Google Drive folder, in the `~\SACAC-EDA-2024\data` subfolder.
